# Ocean Notes – Next.js Frontend

A modern, accessible notes application UI following the Ocean Professional theme.

Quick start:
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run development server: `npm run dev`
- Open http://localhost:3000

Environment:
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to enable backend CRUD.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAGS` (JSON or comma list) to toggle experiments.
- When no backend is configured, the app runs with a clear banner and uses an in-memory store (non-persistent).

See README.NOTES.md for details.
